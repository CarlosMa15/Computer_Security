Steganography comes from the Greek steganos (covered or secret) and -graphy (writing
or drawing). A reported early example was to shave the head of a messenger and tattoo a message on their scalp. Once the hair grows back, the messenger can be sent to the intended recipient. Even if they are physically searched, they don't appear to be carrying any messages. At the destination, the messenger's head can be shaved and the message recovered.
